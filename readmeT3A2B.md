# R1: At a minimum use the following technologies:
## - MongoDB
## - Express
## - React
## - Node

Yep, we did it guys! Our MERN app uses all those four building blocks and more üôåüèΩ


# R2: Write well designed code that:
## - Separates the program into modules that each deal with one particular focus, or concern
## - Demonstrates DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself) coding principles
## - Uses appropriate libraries
## - Demonstrates good code flow control for user stories
## - Applies Object Oriented (OO) principles/patterns
## - Uses appropriate data structures

We also learned that full stack projects have loooots of files - even files that are well organised!

We also learned that even though Tailwind is AMAZING to set formatting and styles in line, it doesn't end up looking super DRY when similar objects are needing slightly different formatting.


# R3: Employ and utilise proper source control methodology (git)

Goodness gracious, we went HARD on this one! 


# R4: Demonstrate your ability to work in a team:
## - Use a recognised project management methodology
## - Use a recognised task delegation methodology


# R5: Produce a working application that meets client and user needs

We're very proud of the I Got You, Boo forum (as are DudeBros Inc. and our users!). The IGYB page can be found here: https://igotyouboo.netlify.app/

# R6: Deploy the application to a cloud hosting service

We've utilised Netlify for the front end, and Heroku for the back end - so hosted on both sides by cloud services and having a great time up here!

# R7: Produce an application with an intuitive user interface


# R8: Provides evidence of user testing:
## - In the development environment
## - In the production environment


# R9: A link (URL) to your deployed website

You've got a few links to this already, but just making we tick the right boxes at this point!

Drumroll, please...

# R10: A link to your GitHub repository (repo)
## Ensure the repo is accessible by your educators!

You got it, folks!
