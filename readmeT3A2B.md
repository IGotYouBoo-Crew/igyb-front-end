# R1: At a minimum use the following technologies:
## - MongoDB
## - Express
## - React
## - Node

Yep, we did it guys! Our MERN app uses all those four building blocks and more üôåüèΩ

# R2: Write well designed code that:
## - Separates the program into modules that each deal with one particular focus, or concern
## - Demonstrates DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself) coding principles
## - Uses appropriate libraries
## - Demonstrates good code flow control for user stories
## - Applies Object Oriented (OO) principles/patterns
## - Uses appropriate data structures

We also learned that full stack projects have loooots of files - even files that are well organised!

We also learned that even though Tailwind is AMAZING to set formatting and styles in line, it doesn't end up looking super DRY when similar objects are needing slightly different formatting.

<br>

# R3: Employ and utilise proper source control methodology (git)

Goodness gracious, we went HARD on this one! 

<br>

# R4: Demonstrate your ability to work in a team:
## - Use a recognised project management methodology
## - Use a recognised task delegation methodology

Reflecting on the 4 Agile values, they served as the guiding principles for our team throughout the development of the I Got You, Boo (IGYB) website:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a project plan

Ella, Jack, and Naomi have successfully embodied these Agile values in our collaborative effort to develop the I Got You, Boo (IGYB) website.

We initiated our teamwork through a single long message thread on Discord, quickly realizing the depth and complexity of the assignment Focused conversations, channels for specific topics/features, threads to go into depth on different matters, even just a place to quickly share resources, applicable tutorials, and relevant links were crucial to this running smoothly. 

We stuck with Discord as a central 'communication hub', but instead of a single messy message thread, created a Discord Server which was honestly a monumental win for us.

The first value of Agile (being *Individuals and interactions over processes and tools*) was one that we really upheld well. Life has been crazy at moments for all of us this past month, so being flexible with each other and working together was key. We even had a timezone bot added, so that times for online meetings between the three of us would show in our local timezones (as all three of us were in different states!):

![Alt text](docs/discordMeetings.png)

We had two categories in order to quickly separate conversations, with channels inside these, and threads for individual comments inside those!

- INFORMATION
    - notes-resources
    - resources
        - tutorials 
        - icons in use
    - tips-and-tricks
        - GitHub Desktop Rebasing

![Resources channel with threads](docs/discordResources.png)

Obviously, these are labelled sensibly so they're easily understood and we knew exactly where to post different comments based on needs/topic.

As we were at times simultaneously working in/on the same files, the **not-quite-stand-up** channel was to communicate exactly what we'd be doing and when, in order to lessen conflicts when eventually merging.

![Not quite stand up channel](docs/discordStandUp.png)

Admittedly, we often utilised the **VOICE CHANNEL Meeting Room**, where we could all be online and just chat to each other, and communicate there who would be doing what. When that was the case, posting in **not-quite-stand-up** would have ended up with unnecessary messages clogging the server, and we ended up finding a beautiful balance that worked for our team really well.

One of the busiest channels was **pull-requests**, where we would post each pull request for the branch we were finished with, in order to merge that work into the Main branch of the repository (either front or backend).

![Pull requests channel](docs/discordPR.png)

The visual task delegation we utilised was our [Trello board üóì](https://trello.com/b/y0rODp16/got-you-boo) from Part A of the assignment. It made sense to all of us to keep the same board and simply build upon it, to show a complete working history.


Originally, we agreed that organising the Trello board into a few specific cards with colour coded labels made the most sense and would be easy to follow. Luckily, the cards were able to remain the same:

CARDS:
- Resources
- To Do
- Naomi Ongoing
- Ella Ongoing
- Jack Ongoing
- Done!
- Blocked

![Trello board](docs/trello.png)

However, we did build up our labels from the beginning in order to better track workload:

ORIGINAL LABELS:
- Set up 
- Planning 
- In Progress 

ADDITIONAL LABELS:
- Done! 
- HELP PLEASE 
- Front-End 
- Back-End 
- Coding 
- Level: EASY-PEASY 
- Level: MEDIUM RARE 
- Level: BOSS 

*Note:* Naomi did create a 'Done!' label for a hot minute during Part A, but quickly realised this was redundant (beyond adding another colour to the mix for the fun of it) because the Trello board already included a 'Done!' card. **HOWEVER**, we all liked the satisfaction of labelling something *Done!* as well as moving it to the 'Done!' card, so we kept both for the extra little morale boost üòâ

![Trello labels](docs/trelloLabels.png)

Within the 'bulkier' items on our cards, we could add descriptions of what was required, as well as due dates and checklists. Each of us had slightly different ways of approaching this, but across the board (pun intended), we had the overall same attitude and work put in. We found it fun to see how each other approached similar tasks with alternative spins, and learnt from each other along the way,

![Trello card](docs/trelloCard.png)

# <span style="color:red"> *NOTE: Need to add git to trello board and update screenshots before submission* </span>

We weren't about sticking to a rigid plan, because it wasn't realistic and didn't feel like 'us'. Instead, we found our process was about embracing change, learning, and refining based on insights gained through meetings, discussions and collaborative feedback.

With that said, the [Figma Wireframes](https://www.figma.com/file/ygmt0g4Y5Q87a7FHad6Xll/I-Got-You%2C-Boo?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=SttEmwEa2vDQyqSZ-0) for our overall design and therefore game plan  of how to bring it to life were AMAZING!

By having those complete sketches - which looked more like screenshots of an already finished product! - we were able to tailor our code and not waste extra time figuring it out along the way, whilst remaining realistic with our abilities and keeping that fine balance of not biting off more than we could chew. These also meant that we could adapt the finished project as we brought the website together and fine tuned functionality, user experience and aesthetic.

# R5: Produce a working application that meets client and user needs

We're very proud of the I Got You, Boo forum (as are DudeBros Inc. and our users!). The IGYB page can be found here: https://igotyouboo.netlify.app/

Once the majority of our site was deployed and functional, we were able to cross reference with an easy-to-read production testing table (based on the *Revised User Stories* that were completed in Part A), and ensure that we covered all bases:

# R6: Deploy the application to a cloud hosting service

We've utilised Netlify for the front end, and Heroku for the back end - so hosted on both sides by cloud services and having a great time up here!

<br>

# R7: Produce an application with an intuitive user interface

<br>

# R8: Provides evidence of user testing:
## - In the development environment
## - In the production environment
<br>

# R9: A link (URL) to your deployed website

You've got a few links to this already, but just making we tick the right boxes at this point!

Drumroll, please...
