# R1: At a minimum use the following technologies:

## - MongoDB

## - Express

## - React

## - Node

Yep, we did it guys! Our MERN app uses all those four building blocks and more üôåüèΩ

You can see it in action in both our [Frontend Repo](https://github.com/IGotYouBoo-Crew/igyb-front-end) and our [Backend Repo](https://github.com/IGotYouBoo-Crew/igyb-back-end).

Additional libraries that we incorporated across both front and backend for additional functionality such as date handling, routing, icon integration, and testing are detailed below:

IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER:

- **bcrypt** - everyone's favourite library for hashing passwords
- **cookie-parser** - this is the middleware that we chose to utilise for parsing cookies in Express
- **cors** - the sometimes troublesome, but necessary middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- **dates-fns** and **dayjs** - both JavaScript libraries used for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates across the site
- **dot env** - the module that loads environment variables from our .env file
- **express** - because it's literally in the MERN name! This is the web framework for Node.js
- **helmet** - collection of middleware that allowed us to secure our app by setting HTTP headers
- **jest** - our chosen JavaScript testing framework. This was exceptional in helping find our testing coverage of code as well!
- **jsonwebtoken** - the library for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), for security
- **mongoose** - mongoose was the ODM of choice for us, smoothing over the otherwise convoluted process of making MQL requests from JS, by letting us treat our documents as objects
- **nodemon** - So. Helpful. This here is a tool that helped us by automatically restarting the app (as it's a Node application) when file changes in the directory were detected. 
- **react-icons** - a big, beautiful collection of React icons that were perfect for IGYB. This is where we got our icons for everything from the phone and email for our Contact Page, to the pencil on editable fields, or arrows on buttons to view more posts.
- **react-router-dom** - the good old standard routing library for a lot of React apps (if it ain't broke, don't fix it!). This was easy to integrate, and we were all familiar with it, so made sense to utilise for enabling navigation
- **react-tailwindcss-datepicker** - this was a nightmare to work with intially, as it's typically a date _range_ picker. In order to select just a single date and shoot that through to the backend took a little tweaking, as did being able to view the pop up calendar in different screensizes, as forms were in modals - which cuts overflow!
- **validator** - The Validator package is for data validation. It provides a set of utility functions to validate various data types, including URLs, email addresses, credit card numbers, and more. We have used this package to validate the input in a photo field to ensure it is a valid URL link. The validator package is typically distributed under the MIT license, which is a permissive open-source license. The MIT license allows you to use, modify, and distribute the software freely, but it comes with no warranty. 
- **supertest** and **supertest-session** - these libraries were used for testing HTTP assertions, and managing the sessions in supertest to test our cookie authorisation

<br>

# R2: Write well designed code that:

## - Separates the program into modules that each deal with one particular focus, or concern

## - Demonstrates DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself) coding principles

## - Uses appropriate libraries

## - Demonstrates good code flow control for user stories

## - Applies Object Oriented (OO) principles/patterns

## - Uses appropriate data structures

We learned that full stack projects have loooots of files - even files that are well organised and following a set pattern!

We also learned that while Tailwind is AMAZING to set formatting and styles inline, it doesn't always end up looking super DRY when similar objects are needing slightly different specs (which can't just be put into a custom class and passed across elements). Technically, it's still DRY - as you _aren't_ able to repeat the bulk of those styles - it just doesn't look super slick.

TAILWIND IN USE, WITH DIFFERENT FORMATTING REQUIRED:

![Tailwind classnames](docs/tailwindClassnames.png)

TAILWIND CUSTOM STYLES:

![Tailwind components](docs/tailwindComponents.png)

![Tailwind updates](docs/tailwindUpdates.png)

And honestly, using React made using libraries and packages, and overall code flow and object oriented patterns super easy!

We were able to set files out in bite sized chunks, and follow a pattern for building pages in different components and then bringing them all together as imports one after the other.

The real beauty of this was that files weren't crazy large and hard to follow; they made sense, and tackling the overall project piece by piece like this worked like a charm.

More details on the libraries used is back in R1 - figured you probably wouldn't want to read it twice, so left it with 'technologies' question.

<br>

# R3: Employ and utilise proper source control methodology (git)

Goodness gracious, we went HARD on this one!

As of the 17th December, our code frequency graphs show how dedicated we've been:

![Backend graph](docs/backendGraph.png)

![Frontend graph](docs/frontendGraph.png)

It's been fun to update this and see how the frequency of additions and deletions has changed as we've neared the end of the assignment:

![Backend Updated graph](docs/backendGraphUpdated.png)

![Frontend Updated graph](docs/frontendGraphUpdated.png)

We followed a **trunk-based** gitflow: While maintaining a centralised Main branch as our "trunk", we would develop small-scale additions and features in personal branches. Staying away from anyone working in the **main branch** in order to lessen any potential/accidental conflicts or overrides, as well as protecting our deployed sites from potential issues.

We each created our **own branches** off the main based on our individual focus/features. Within these branches, we would make our changes and commits.

![branches](docs/branches.png)
![branches2](docs/branches2.png)

When we were ready to merge into main, we'd **rebase our branch** first. This ensured that any pull requests that happened _while_ we were working on our branch would automatically be incorporated in the merge, and no one accidentally 'undoes' any of the progress we had collectively been making.

Once this rebase was complete, we'd make a **pull request**. We decided to include a requirement for a second team member to approve any pull request: this way, it just covered our butts having a second set of eyes scanning over the additions and deletions that were being brought into the main code for additional peace of mind.

We also required that all **status checks** were clear before a merge could be made. For the front end, this meant ensuring that netlify successfully deployed the site without issue, while for the backend, we used **Github Actions** to automate testing our routes. 

In order to flag with one another that there was a pull request waiting, we'd use the good old **pull-requests** channel in Discord:

![Discord pull requests](docs/discordPR.png)

Once that pull request was **squashed and merged** (squashing being the term for taking every commit made on a single branch and 'squashing' them into what appears to be one commit, which keeps code cleaner!), we would **delete the branch** and then create a new one in order to keep the repos cleaner - with no redundant branches.

This approach ensured that work was completed in more of a step by step 'sprint' fashion. We would discuss daily the sections and features each of us were working on, help each other where needed, and then bring our changes to the main branch in order to work efficiently and effectively.

<br>

# R4: Demonstrate your ability to work in a team:

## - Use a recognised project management methodology

## - Use a recognised task delegation methodology

Reflecting on the 4 Agile values, they served as the guiding principles for our team throughout the development of the I Got You, Boo (IGYB) website:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a project plan

Ella, Jack, and Naomi have successfully embodied these Agile values in our collaborative effort to develop the I Got You, Boo (IGYB) website.

We initiated our teamwork through a single long message thread on Discord, quickly realizing the depth and complexity of the assignment Focused conversations, channels for specific topics/features, threads to go into depth on different matters, even just a place to quickly share resources, applicable tutorials, and relevant links were crucial to this running smoothly.

We stuck with Discord as a central 'communication hub', but instead of a single messy message thread, we created a Discord Server so that we could separate discussions into different boards and threads which was honestly a monumental win for us. 

The first value of Agile (being _Individuals and interactions over processes and tools_) was one that we really upheld well. Life has been crazy at moments for all of us this past month, so being flexible with each other and working together was key. We even had a timezone bot added, so that times for online meetings between the three of us would show in our local timezones (as all three of us were in different states!):

![Alt text](docs/discordMeetings.png)

We had two categories in order to quickly separate conversations, with channels inside these, and threads for individual comments inside those!

- INFORMATION 
  - notes-resources 
  - resources 
    - icons in use 
    - tips-and-tricks 
  - tutorials 
    - GitHub Desktop Rebasing
  <br>

- TEXT CHANNELS
  - general
  - meeting-planning
  - off-topic
  - not-quite-stand-up
  - help-troubleshooting
    - It just won'd do anything ...
    - Any ideas on how to ...
    - CORS problem
    - Alrighty, I've got two issues here ...

    - PR for backend: [Cookies added] ...
    - Backend pull20
    - Feature comments section by Ella ...
  - issues-to-fix
  - wouldnt-it-be-nice

![Resources channel with threads](docs/discordResources.png)

Obviously, these are labelled sensibly so they're easily understood and we knew exactly where to post different comments based on needs/topic.

As we were at times simultaneously working in/on the same files, the **not-quite-stand-up** channel was to communicate exactly what we'd be doing and when, in order to lessen conflicts when eventually merging and prevent two people from building the same feature at the same time.

![Not quite stand up channel](docs/discordStandUp.png)

Admittedly, we often utilised the **VOICE CHANNEL Meeting Room**, where we could all be online and just chat to each other, and communicate there who would be doing what. When that was the case, posting in **not-quite-stand-up** would have ended up with unnecessary messages clogging the server, and we ended up finding a beautiful balance that worked for our team really well.

One of the busiest channels was **pull-requests**, where we would post each pull request for the branch we were finished with, in order to merge that work into the Main branch of the repository (either front or backend).

![Pull requests channel](docs/discordPR.png)

The visual task delegation we utilised was our [Trello board üóì](https://trello.com/b/y0rODp16/got-you-boo) from Part A of the assignment. It made sense to all of us to keep the same board and simply build upon it, to show a complete working history.

Originally, we agreed that organising the Trello board into a few specific cards with colour coded labels made the most sense and would be easy to follow. Luckily, the cards were able to remain the same:

CARDS:

- Resources
- To Do
- Naomi Ongoing
- Ella Ongoing
- Jack Ongoing
- Done!
- Blocked

![Trello board](docs/trello.png)
![Trello board](docs/Trello_wk1.png)
![Trello board](docs/Trello_wk2.png)
![Trello board](docs/Trello_Final.png)

However, we did build up our labels from the beginning in order to better track workload:

ORIGINAL LABELS:

- Set up
- Planning
- In Progress

ADDITIONAL LABELS:

- Done!
- HELP PLEASE
- Front-End
- Back-End!
- Coding
- Level: EASY-PEASY
- Level: MEDIUM RARE
- Level: BOSS

_Note:_ Naomi did create a 'Done!' label for a hot minute during Part A, but quickly realised this was redundant (beyond adding another colour to the mix for the fun of it) because the Trello board already included a 'Done!' card. **HOWEVER**, we all liked the satisfaction of labelling something _Done!_ as well as moving it to the 'Done!' card, so we kept both for the extra little morale boost üòâ

![Trello labels](docs/trelloLabels.png)

Within the 'bulkier' items on our cards, we could add descriptions of what was required, as well as due dates and checklists. Each of us had slightly different ways of approaching this, but across the board (pun intended), we had the overall same attitude and work put in. We found it fun to see how each other approached similar tasks with alternative spins, and learnt from each other along the way,

![Trello card](docs/trelloCard.png)

![Trello card2](docs/trelloCard2.png)

We weren't about sticking to a rigid plan, because it wasn't realistic and didn't feel like 'us'. Instead, we found our process was about embracing change, learning, and refining based on insights gained through meetings, discussions and collaborative feedback.

With that said, the [Figma Wireframes](https://www.figma.com/file/ygmt0g4Y5Q87a7FHad6Xll/I-Got-You%2C-Boo?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=SttEmwEa2vDQyqSZ-0) for our overall design and therefore game plan of how to bring it to life were AMAZING!

By having those complete sketches - which looked more like screenshots of an already finished product! - we were able to tailor our code and not waste extra time figuring it out along the way, whilst remaining realistic with our abilities and keeping that fine balance of not biting off more than we could chew. These also meant that we could adapt the finished project as we brought the website together and fine tuned functionality, user experience and aesthetic.

![Figma wireframe](docs/figma.png)

WIREFRAMES FOR FORUM/POSTS:

![Figma close up](docs/figmaClose.png)

FINISHED DEPLOYED PAGES FOR FORUM/POSTS:

![Forum page](docs/forum.png)

And there are a heck of a lot more screenshots that have been relegated to [the end of the README](#screenshots) to avoid you having to scroll past them #youarewelcome ü•≥

We've been exceptionally lucky that we each have different strengths we could bring to the table, that complemented one another and was invaluable to the project.

While we all had parts of the code that we individually focused on and brought to life, there were obvious strengths that each of us could tap into.

In no particular order:

Ella was Queen of design and front end, taking the reigns for Figma wireframes, colour scheme, fonts, layout, after some big brainstorming with Jack and Naomi to begin with.

Jack was our Wizard of Code (and felt like our very own Educator at times!); creating an impressive skeleton we were able to springboard off of, and someone we could constantly turn to when our Google searches and forum diving turned unfruitful.

Naomi was Guru of documentation, pulling together all the words, screenshots, and explanations that should lock in top marks for this assignment (surely, Educators?!).

There have been too many 2am Discord Meeting Room troubleshooting sessions, shifts at work given up, and even a delayed trip to be with family for Christmas in order to finish this project strong. We'd say that 'finish strong' is exactly what we've done here. Together, we did an amazing job, and learnt a heck of a lot along the way.

# R5: Produce a working application that meets client and user needs

We're very proud of the I Got You, Boo forum (as are the big dawgs DudeBros Inc. and all of our users!).

The IGYB page can be found here: https://igotyouboo.netlify.app/

<br>

# R6: Deploy the application to a cloud hosting service

We've utilised Netlify for the front end, and Heroku and Mongo Atlas for the back end - so hosted on both sides by cloud services and having a great time up here!

Netlify allowed us to set environment variables. Obviously, these are automatically hidden from GitHub repositories for security, so the ability to set them in Netlify without having to make them public ensured the site functioned as intended:

![Netlify](docs/netlify.png)

Netlify further has automatic testing built in, which blocked a merge request if the pull request didn't meet the required parameters.

![Netlify fail](docs/netlifyFail.png)

The beauty of this meant that once we had the site up and running, it has basically stayed that way ever since!

Our backend was a combination of Heroku for the business logic, and Mongo Atlas for the database hosting. Heroku had its own ENV variables, such as the database URI, encryption key and salt, and JWT key.

Mongo Atlas didn't require any environment variables beyond a username and password, which are used in the database URI for heroku to connect securely.

![Heroku Variables](./docs/herokuVariables.png)

<br>

# R7: Produce an application with an intuitive user interface

Clearly - and hopefully! - we've done exactly that!

We're extremely proud of the end product, and boasting about this to future employers and internship companies \*cough cough\*.

![Home page](docs/home.png)

<br>

# R8: Provides evidence of user testing:

## - In the development environment

## - In the production environment

Testing was a huuuge part of the entire build process.

We cannot tell you how many times our poor terminals had to deal with `npm run reseed-and-test` when creating and testing our routes, but it was a LOT! 

We had to nail these tests *before* building the code, because as we've been taught: it's a headache enough building tests in order to write code that passes. It's a lot worse though, to write code that you *think* is beautiful and functional, but will never pass a test once you catch up with that!

![npm reseed and test](docs/testReseed.png)

From there, we'd be able to check and cross check all of our routes, and we included about a hundred (not really but it felt like it!) `console.logs` to track exactly where we were, or what would go through, in order to troubleshoot when things *didn't* pass. Better unit testing even *more* early on would've reduced the number of `console.log`-ing that would've been needed, but hindsight is 20-20!

![test routes](docs/testRoutes.png)

Our backend testing has integration tests for the server itself, some of the form validation, and unit testing for functions too:

![test suites](docs/testSuites.png)

Watching all those green words pop up was something we never thought we'd be so excited about!

We included validation for forms in front *and* back end. The front-end validation reduced the overall number of database calls that were required, while the back-end validation ensured that there was no way to circumvent the front-end and add data that could cause issues later. 

FRONT END:
![form validation from front end](docs/testFrontEnd.png)

BACK END:

![form validation from back end](docs/testBackEnd.png)

So, some validation testing was ran through the actual test suites in the back end, and some was simply built into the code (ie. users couldn't submit invalid inputs), which took Ella and Naomi (and Jack, with troubleshooting help!) a whoooole lot of time simply with trial and error. Lesson learned for next time üòâ

![test validation from back end](docs/testValidation.png)

This was largely due to two very different approaches. 

As mentioned above, Jack is our Wizard of Code, and has his own super impressive, natural style of coding. Meanwhile Ella had found what *appeared* to be great tutorials for almost *exactly* what we were wanting to achieve, and that's what she and Naomi based most of the *Posts* and *Events* code on. However, in the long run, we can all admit that those tutorials almost caused more headaches!

We got there though, and have all learned SO MUCH from all the back and forth of helping each other and having to figure out what one another were trying to do and how they were trying to get there... So, with the aim of this entire assignment being for us to learn how to work in a team and create something functional and beautiful, we'd all agree that we nailed this! ü•≥

Back to the testing...

Like we said: there were a lot of tests in order to be thorough.

Once the majority of our site was deployed and functional, we were able to cross reference with an easy-to-read production testing table (based on the _Revised User Stories_ that were completed in Part A), and ensure that we covered all bases:

![Production testing table](docs/production_test_progress.png)

UPDATED TESTING TABLE

![Production testing updated table](docs/production_test_update.png)


<br>

# R9: Utilises a formal testing framework

We've gone over a whole lot of the testing information above already, so no need to repeat ourselves too much here, right? (README's should be DRY too, I reckon!)

However, it's still worth mentioning here perhaps that some branch coverage appears low. This is largely due to a lot of them only being available *outside* of the test environment (in development or production). 

Some other branches were for catching specific cases which later changes to the code made (theoretically) unreachable. With some error handling being coded directly into the functions (mentioned above - with the front end form validation), the tests being completed cannot cover some of the error-handling branches. Hence, when we run coverage, it pretty much says *"You tested this function, but you only tested half the branches"*.

![test coverage](docs/testCoverage.png)

# R12: The contents of your `README.md` as submitted for `Full Stack App - Part A`

We tossed up trying to include the *entire* Part A README, but came to the conclusion that that would be ridiculous, suuurely.

Based on Alex's answer in Discord to that same/similar question, we hope that all the information above and the comments in our user test spreadsheet cover the minor changes we've made as we've progressed through.
